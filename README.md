# Providing Statistical Distributions in SetlX
The scope of the report is to illustrate the work of León Mutschke and Jonas Siefker during their seminar
assignment at the Cooperative State University Baden Wuerttemberg in Mannheim. It shows the task, ideas,
concepts and development of implementing certain statistical distributions in the programming language SetlX.

## What is SetlX?
SetlX (SET Language Extended) is an interpreted high-level programming language. It was and is mostly
designed by Prof. Dr. Karl Stroetmann. However, SetlX is an evolution of the high-level programming
language SETL, designed by Jacob T. Schwartz. Both languages are based on the mathematical theory of sets
and offers many mathematical algorithms. SetlX was designed to make the unique features of SETL more
accessible to today’s computer science students.

## How to compile?
You can compile the document with the following command:

```pdflatex seminarpaper.tex```

## Regression Test Example
The repository includes a folder named "Example". This folder contains a `.csv` file and two `.stlx` files for a regression test example. The example itself is described in the report. To execute the SetlX program, run:

```setlx simple-linear-regression.stlx```

Make sure, that you run the SetlX version, that contains the implemented statistical distributions.
