\chapter*{Abstract}

	This paper documents the work of the two authors Le\'{o}n Mutschke and Jonas Siefker during their seminar assignment. The document shows the development preparations, describes the implementation of certain statistical distributions in the high-level programming language \setlx, introduces the implemented functions and describes the testing of these functions. \SetlX is a continuation of the programming language SETL, and is built around operating on sets and lists. Originally developed by \href{https://github.com/karlstroetmann}{Prof. Dr. Karl Stroetmann} and \href{https://github.com/herrmanntom}{Tom Herrmann}, \setlX is now subject to change through the students of the Corporative State University Mannheim, mostly as part of seminar papers similar to the subject of this document.
