\section*{What is \setlx?}

	\setlx\ (\textbf{SET} \textbf{L}anguage E\textbf{x}tended) is an interpreted high-level programming language. It was and is mostly designed by \href{https://github.com/karlstroetmann}{Prof. Dr. Karl Stroetmann} and \href{https://github.com/herrmanntom}{Tom Herrmann}. However, \setlx\ is an evolution of the high-level programming language SETL, designed by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_T._Schwartz}{Jacob T. Schwartz}. Both languages are based on the mathematical theory of sets and offer many mathematical algorithms. \setlx\ was designed to make the unique features of SETL more accessible to today's computer science students. In accordance with this, the original syntax of SETL has been changed to reflect the one of the programming language C, which the students learn in their first semester. \setlx\ can be downloaded \href{https://randoom.org/Software/SetlX}{here}.\footnote{\url{https://randoom.org/Software/SetlX}}
