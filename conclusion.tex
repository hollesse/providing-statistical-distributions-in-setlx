\chapter{Conclusion}

	As developing additional features for \setlx\ was planned by the original developers, the core framework to do so is cleary structured and makes it rather easy to get involved into the matter. Yet it still provides a challenge and is thus well suited as a task for a seminar paper like the one of the authoring students. As this was probably not the last time students develop new features for \setlx\, this document should besides documenting the work of the authors also serve as  an introduction and guide for anyone working on new \setlx\ features.
