\section*{What is \setlx?}

	\setlx\ (\textbf{SET} \textbf{L}anguage E\textbf{x}tended) is an interpreted high-level programming language. It was and is mostly designed by \href{https://github.com/karlstroetmann}{Prof. Dr. Karl Stroetmann}. However, \setlx\ is an evolution of the high-level programming language SETL, designed by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_T._Schwartz}{Jacob T. Schwartz}. Both languages are based on the mathematical theory of sets and offers many mathematical algorithms. \setlx\ was designed to make the unique features of SETL more accessible to today's computer science students. \setlx\ can be downloaded \href{https://randoom.org/Software/SetlX}{here}.
