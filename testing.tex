\chapter{Testing the Implementation}

	This chapter describes the process of testing the implementation. As defined in the task, the values of the statistical distributions implemented in \setlx\ should be compared with the values computed in the programming language R or Python. The programming language Python was chosen due to existing knowledge. The \setlx\ interpreter already possesses a script which tests examples located in a specific example folder, named \lstinline{example_SetlX_code}.
